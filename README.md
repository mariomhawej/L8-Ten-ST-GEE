# Ten-ST-GEE
Ten-ST-GEE is a user-friendly, much-needed, open-access 10-m LST retrieval system. It applies straightforward approaches while combining two satellite sensors, namely the Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2. While being hosted within the GEE, users has the ability to implement the proposed system in any region worldwide in a matter of few seconds, storing information locally or on the cloud and finally, incorporating such information in other environmental models including wildfires, drought, evapotranspiration, urban heat, among many others. Ten-ST-GEE has shown an RMSE of 1.1°C compared to 2.6°C using the original DisTrad method in three different climatic regions and four different locations. Thus, it can be implemented in other areas, particularly where different performance tests are already embedded within the system. The much-improved spatial resolution Ten-ST-GEE system is freely available from the authors for research and educational purposes at https://bit.ly/3n6koz9.
