# Ten-ST-GEE
Ten-ST-GEE has the ability to automatically transform 100-m to 10-m LST at Landsat-8 overpass time. Statistical and regression analysis as well as bandpass adjustments were used in this system. Ten-ST-GEE was applied over two agricultural lands and two urban regions in the United States and in Lebanon. The proposed approach seemed most valuable when producing information even at the building-level or showing the heterogeneity of the agricultural parcels.
